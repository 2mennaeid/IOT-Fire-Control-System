# IOT-Fire-Control-System
Implemented a prototype for an IoT-based fire control system using an ESP32 microcontroller. The system integrates temperature and gas sensors, connected to the ESP32, to monitor environmental conditions. The data collected by the sensors is transmitted to a designated application through the MQTT protocol over a Wi-Fi connection
